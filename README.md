# Anomaly-Detection-with-CNN-Auto-encoder
This project implements and analyzes different autoencoder architectures from scratch for anomaly detection, on MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains thousands of images of handwritten digits and is commonly used for classification purposes. However, in this case, it is used for outlier (anomaly) detection. 

Three types of auto-encoders is used for analysis. They are i) Auto-encoder (AE) based on dense neural network (MLP); ii) Over-complete AE ; iii) CNN based AE. Among them, CNN based AE had better performance at detecting Anomalies. Please refer the jupyter notebook and report for further details.

PyTorch is used to train and evaluate the network.
